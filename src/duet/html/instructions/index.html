        <p>Codenames is a game played by 4 or more players in which players are split into two teams, red and blue, and guess words based on clues from their teammates.[2] One player from each team becomes a spymaster, and the others are field operatives.[3] The end goal is to place all of the team’s agent tiles.
    
            <p>During setup, 25 cards containing words are randomly laid out in a 5x5 grid. Some represent red agents (red squares), some represent blue agents (blue squares), one represents the assassin (black square), and the rest are innocent bystanders (beige squares). The spymasters receive a randomly dealt card with colored squares representing the words. They must help their field operatives guess the words representing their agents while avoiding opposing agents, innocent bystanders, and the assassin. The ‘lights’ on the key card represent which team will go first and have an extra agent that must be placed.
            </p>
            <p>Each turn, the spymaster gives a verbal clue containing only a single word and a number. The verbal clue should represent correctly colored cards in some way. For example, for the cards ‘beach’, ‘whale’, and ‘water’, one could give the clue ‘ocean’, as these things are all related to the ocean. The number represents how many cards fit that clue. The single word must be related by meaning, so it cannot be purely phonetically related. It also cannot be or contain any word on the board. If an invalid clue is given – the clue is explicitly invalidated by the opposing spymaster – the turn ends immediately and the opposing team gets to randomly reveal one of their own agents.
            </p>
            <p>After the verbal clue is given, the field operatives must guess words that go with the clue, and the word will subsequently be covered with an agent tile, an assassin tile, or a bystander tile by the spymaster. The field operatives must make at least one guess per turn, with the maximum number of guesses being the number given in the clue plus one. Once a correct guess is made, the field operatives may continue to make guesses or choose to end their turn voluntarily. If a bystander or an enemy agent is revealed, the turn ends. If the assassin is revealed, the game ends immediately with a loss for the guessing team. For a faster game, or in certain situations such as when the opposing team takes too long guessing, a timer, such as the hourglass timer included in the game's packaging, can be used.
            </p>
            <p>Besides the assassin, the game ends when all of one team’s agents are guessed, winning the game for that team.</p>
